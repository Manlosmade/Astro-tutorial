# Astro tutorial
## _Finished_

This is a repo to save my progress off the [Astro Blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/). I have finished this tutorial as off the 3rd of April 2023. I have done everything except for the Astro api and Islands as that is unneccary for me to learn for the project I want to do. 

I have learned:

- Astro components
- Astro Pages
- Astro styling
- Astro Layouts
- Netlify and Gitub
- Dynamic content
- Sending scripts to the browser
