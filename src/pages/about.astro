        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>... and this site!</h2>
      
        <p>Hi! This is Gabriel a student developer in the UK. This is a blog about computers and Polotics - especially Geopolotics. Hence the day Compolotics!
        This is mostly a hobby project so don't judge me if there is a month gap between posts or an hour gap!
        </p>
      
        <p>Please take everything I say with many grains of salt and definitly get your news from somewhere else because I am a student with no training in Journalism or Political correspondances!</p>	</body>
